# Forms and navigation

Create a new repo for this task and publish it to GitHub Pages.

## Task 0
Research next topics:
- Links and navigation (complete tasks inside): https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks
- HTML Forms (complete tasks inside): https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Learn/Forms

## Task 1
Using only HTML and CSS implement multi step form with navigation between steps.

- no JS
- don't need to save any values and manipulate with entered data
- user should be able to navigate between steps with buttons: "Previous" and "Next"
- form styles is optional, so feel free to show your UI/UX skills
- every form input should use proper ["type"](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp)

> TIP: Each form step should be in a separate HTML file, but this task it's not a best practice and used for training purposes only. In modern world you wouldn't navigate between two HTML files to operate one form, because of different paradigm.
