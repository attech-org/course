## Task 1

Learn JS using great book https://javascript.info/. I'm not quite happy with the new order of chapters in latest editions of book, so please follow this custom way:

1. https://javascript.info/getting-started
2. https://javascript.info/first-steps
3. https://javascript.info/code-quality
4. https://javascript.info/data-types
5. https://javascript.info/object-basics
6. https://javascript.info/advanced-functions
7. https://javascript.info/error-handling
8. https://javascript.info/async
9. https://javascript.info/modules

In addition, to learning JS with provided book, feel free to use any additional resources, like YouTube videos, or some alternative courses. Covering each topic from different sides can be helpful for your understanding + can give you more insights. I can suggest this resources, but it's not strict, please use what you like.

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. Don't try to read more than 3 topics per day. It'll keep your mind fresh on long distance and will help to not mess up with huge amount of incoming data.

2. Solve EVERY task at the end of each topic. I know how tempting it is to solve a task in "theory", till you keep everything fresh in your head, because you just completed reading about it. It's a wrong way! Write code, write obvious code, write dumb code â€“ practice, but never skip tasks and never solve them just "in theory".

3. Don't open answers before you solved a task. It's totally fine to spend 1-2 hours for task, and it's not a reason to give up and see correct answers. Trust me, this cheating will break the whole learning process.

Try to follow with next algorithm, when solving tasks (move to the next step only in case if previous wasn't helpful):

1. self attempts (1 hour)
2. googling for similar tasks (15 mins)
3. asking mentor for help
