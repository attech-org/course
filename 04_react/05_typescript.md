# Typescript

## Research

1. Read official guide ["TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
2. Briefly check two guides: [react with TS](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide#react-types-cheatsheet) and [react-redux with TS (README file of repository)](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide#react-types-cheatsheet)
3. Check article ["Adding Typescript"](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) to "create-react-app"

## Level 1

1. Add Typescript to a ToDoList project and refactor all your code to be "true" Typescript. Avoid using `any` as a type, because it's actually hack, that should be used for data, that you can't control. But you can control your project, right?))
