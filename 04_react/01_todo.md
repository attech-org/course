# ToDo list with React

Welcome to first React practice task. It's pretty basic and most popular task for first experiments. We're following the same tradition.

## Research

I can recommend to check this [one-by-one guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started) to understand React a bit more better. Here you also can find a TODO -list app implementation instructions, but keep in mind, you should just be inspired by this example, not copy/paste.

## Level 1

1. Bootstrap react application with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/)
2. Create a repo on GitHub and connect with your local react application repository
3. Implement TODO app with next logic:
    - user can create task, by entering some text to input, and clicking submit button
    - user can read created tasks in list
    - user can update each task, by clicking on "edit" button near task text, changing task text in input and pressing "save" button when complete
    - user can delete each task, by clicking on "delete" button near task text
4. Styles is not important at this step, so feel free to style this app as you want, but only with pure CSS.

## Level 2

To work on this task please create a new branch in your repo, based on main, where you have [Level #1](#level-1) done.

1. Add logic to keep all tasks data in [`localSotrage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
2. Add statistic counter on top of tasks list to show count of:
    - created tasks
    - updated tasks
    - deleted tasks
