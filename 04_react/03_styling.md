# Styling tools for React app

## Research
1. Read "getting started" documentation of [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
2. [Quick guide about SCSS(Sass)](https://sass-lang.com/guide) and [Sass in create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet)
3. [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and [css-modules in create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/)

## Level 1

1. Install `styled-components` to project
2. Implement styling for "TODO list item" and "TODO list input" components using `styled-components` tool. It means, that styles that you adding should affect only for these two components. If you haven't this kind of components, that means your TODO-list app is not really "react-ish", and you need to refactor your code.

## Level 2

1. Install `scss` and `css-modules` to project
2. Implement styling for "general layout" components using `scss` and `css-modules`. These kind of styles should affect only on layout (positions & sizes of blocks on a page).

## Level 3

1. Implement logic, that generate random background color for each new TODO task
2. This color should be saved to localStorage
